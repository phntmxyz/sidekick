## About Dart SDK versions

For your development, use `Dart 3.8` for formatting and linting.
(This is what CI uses for your Pull Requests.)
We try to stay close to [latest](https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive) when possible, to make contributions easy.

We try to support a wide range of Dart versions.
Our current minimum supported version is `Dart 3.5`.

Therefore, have to occasionally switch to a different Dart version (especially our minimum supported version) to fix issues that are not caught by the latest version.
We recommend [puro](https://github.com/pingbird/puro) to switch between Dart/Flutter versions easily.
Do not bump the minimum supported version unnecessarily.
Supporting older versions is usually little effort and allows us to reach most users with updates.
