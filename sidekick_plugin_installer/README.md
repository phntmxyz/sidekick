# Sidekick Plugin Installer

Contains high level helper methods around `analyzer` useful for plugin authors.
The methods can be used in the `tool/install.dart` script to actually integrate your plugin code in to the sidekick CLI.

## Example 

```dart
import 'package:sidekick_core/sidekick_core.dart';
import 'package:sidekick_plugin_installer/sidekick_plugin_installer.dart';

Future<void> main(List<String> args) async {
  // The installer injects the path to the sidekick project as first argument
  final package = SidekickPackage.fromDirectory(Directory(args[0]))!;

  pubAddDependency(package, 'my_sidekick_plugin');
  pubGet(package);

  registerPlugin(
    sidekickCli: package,
    import: "import 'package:my_sidekick_plugin/my_sidekick_plugin.dart';",
    command: 'MyCommand()',
  );
}
```
