## Creating sub commands

  String get description => 'does foo';

  @override
  String get name => 'foo';

## Add commands to your project

```dart
// Generated by `sidekick init`
Future<void> runFlg(List<String> args) async {
  final runner = initializeSidekick(name: 'flg', mainProjectPath: '.');

  flgProject = FlgProject(mainProject.root);

  runner
    ..addCommand(FlutterCommand())
    // more commands
    ..addCommand(InstallGlobalCommand())
    ..addCommand(YourCommand())

### Install cli locally during development

That's useful when you want to test the sidekick cli during development on your machine. Tests are great, but sometimes you want to see the beast in action.

```bash
cd sidekick
dart pub global activate -s path .
```
