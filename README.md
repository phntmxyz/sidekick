```

## Writing custom tasks

## Creating sub commands

```dart
import 'package:sidekick_core/sidekick_core.dart';

class YourCommand extends Command {
  @override
  String get description => 'does foo';

  @override
  String get name => 'foo';
  
  @override
  Future<void> run() {
    // your custom code here
  }
}
```

## Add commands to your project

```dart
// Generated by `sidekick init`
Future<void> runFlg(List<String> args) async {
  final runner = initializeSidekick(name: 'flg', mainProjectPath: '.');

  flgProject = FlgProject(mainProject.root);

  runner
    ..addCommand(FlutterCommand())
    // more commands
    ..addCommand(InstallGlobalCommand())
+   ..addCommand(YourCommand()); // <-- Register your own command

  //...
```

## Development

### Install cli locally during development

That's useful when you want to test the sidekick cli during development on your machine. Tests are great, but sometimes you want to see the beast in action.

```bash
cd sidekick
dart pub global activate -s path .
```
