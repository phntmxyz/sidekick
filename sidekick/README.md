# What is sidekick?

Repetitive CLI tasks can be organized in many ways: READMEs, bash scripts, aliases, run configurations, CI/CD pipelines, etc.  
But all of these approaches have their drawbacks. Instead, a much better way is to create a CLI that is tailored to your project.

The sidekick CLI generator helps you do just that!

Advantages of a custom sidekick CLI for your project:
- Documentation of commands inside the CLI - no more outdated documentation as it is linked to the commands
- Easy language: write commands in Dart instead of complex Bash magic
- Testable/debuggable
- Scoped to project: only the commands you need
- CLI is shared through repo: easy to install and use for new team members

# Getting Started - Generating your own sidekick CLI for your project

Creating your own sidekick CLI is easy. Follow these simple steps to get started:

Make sure you have the `sidekick` CLI generator installed (this package).
```bash
dart pub global activate sidekick
```

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to initialize a new sidekick CLI:
```bash
sidekick init
```

The CLI generator will guide you through the setup process. You will be prompted to provide some information (e.g. name of your CLI) and that's it!

You can now run your own sidekick CLI by calling it from the command line.

# Installing Sidekick CLI Globally and Enabling Tab Completions

To make your Sidekick CLI accessible from anywhere on your system and enable convenient tab completions, run the following command:
```bash
<your-cli-name> sidekick install-global
```

Now restart your terminal or resource your shell profile (e.g. `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`) and you can run your CLI from anywhere with tab completions.

# Available Default Commands and Plugins
The Sidekick CLI comes with a set of default commands to help you get started quickly. Additionally, it supports plugins that can be easily integrated to extend its functionality. Here's a list of some useful default commands and recommended plugins:
